            <li class="portfolio-text">In this project, I synthesized a multiplier hardware onto an FPGA 
                using verilog programming on the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a> platform. 
                To interact with this multiplier device, 
                I compiled linux for FPGA and wrote device drivers that would allow the operating system 
                to communicate with the multiplier. Through this project, 
                I learned about device driver development and how to practically apply devices I make or program.</li>

            <li class="portfolio-text">I have worked frequently with the 
                <a href=https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-pukimv.html> Zybo Z7-10</a> 
                board and have made numerous projects for it using Verilog. One such project was a traffic 
                light controller system, in which hardware was synthesized constituting a finite state machine 
                that would change the state of a light, here represented by the leds on the board, based on input 
                from a clock and a sensor. Projects like this one have allowed me to practice skills in hardware design 
                and programming as well as state machine logic, and have helped build my understanding of digital 
                logic at the hardware level.</li>

            <li class="portfolio-text">I programmed a 
                <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buddy-system-memory-allocation-technique/">Buddy System Memory Allocator </a> in C++. 
                Though managing the memory was difficult, it allowed me to practice memory operations and better understand how memory
                 can be allocated and managed by an operating system or program. The knowledge I gained from this helps me
                  in managing memory in devices, such as the aforementioned FPGA multiplier, as well as in other aspects of my programming.
