                        In my hometown of Galveston, I've regularly been involved in community service including helping orchestrate a recycling program
                        through which people can have their recyclable goods picked up by volunteers to take to the

                        I also briefly volunteered my time playing piano for the residents at the 
                        <a href = "https://www.seniorhousingnet.com/seniorliving-detail/the-meridian_2228-seawall-blvd_galveston_tx_77550-533832">Meridian Assisted Living Facility</a>
                        Other events and organizations I've volunteered with include <a href = "https://gc.edu/edfest-for-all-is-oct-5-in-galveston/">"Edfest,"
                        </a> <a href="https://secure.acsevents.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=relay_get_involved">"Relay for Life,"</a> and

                        My committment to community service has allowed me to meet amazing and inspirational people. It has also given me the opportunity to work with numerous diverse teams of people from
                        all different backgrounds and walks of life, and has helped me practice skills in 
                        leadership, teamwork, and cooperation. Lastly, it has brought me closer to my community and my peers,
                         instilled in me a sense of duty towards helping others when I can, 
                        and shown me the value in hard work towards a worthwhile goal.
