            I'm from Galveston, Texas, and study Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University.
            I'm a junior, and plan on graduating in December of 2021.

            <span class="about-me-text"><br>Growing up, I was always interested in computers. 
                I got my first computer when I was 6 years old, and my older brothers are both software engineers, 
                so I had plenty of time to develop an interest in the field before coming to college. I also had 
                opportunities to develop other hobbies. Like many of my peers, my favorite thing to do when I 
                have the time is to play video games with my friends. Since I grew up in Galveston, I was also able to 
                take up sailing as a hobby and even work as an instructor for the 
                <a href="https://galvestonboatclub.com/team">Galveston Boat Club Summer Sailing Program. </a>
                One of the reasons I love sailing and teaching sailing is because it allows me to practice teamwork, 
                cooperation, communication, organization, problem solving and a wide array of other skills which have been
                 invaluable to me and helped me find success in everything I do, especially engineering.

        <li><span class="about-me-title">Professional Goals and Interests</span> 
            <span class="about-me-text"><br> My goal since before college has been to go into embedded systems engineering.
                The prospect of being able to work with all kinds of electronics for many different applications is 
                particularly appealing to me, as I value being able to try and learn new things continuously throughout
                my life. When working with computers, I usually like to be at a low level, close to the hardware, where there's 
                less abstraction and more explicit interaction with the basic elements of computers. Once I got to college, I 
                found that hardware design and work with FPGAs was also very fulfilling and enjoyable to me, and that problem 
                solving at higher levels of abstraction can be more rewarding and fun than I expected. After college, I plan to 
                join one of these industries and, if all goes well, find a place where I can work with other skilled engineers, 
                make significant contributions to projects that interest me, and lead projects of my own.
